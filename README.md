## Introduction

This project leverages advanced AI techniques to generate questions for SSC (Secondary School Certificate) exams. The primary goal is to assist educators and students by providing a robust tool for creating diverse and comprehensive question sets.

## Features

* **AI-Powered Question Generation:** Utilizes state-of-the-art natural language processing models to generate SSC exam questions.
* **Dataset Integration:** Integrates seamlessly with datasets provided by YouData.ai.
* **Customizable Parameters:** Allows users to customize question generation parameters for tailored outputs.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface for easy use (if applicable).

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided by [YouData.ai](#youdata-link). It includes a comprehensive collection of SSC exam questions categorized by topics and difficulty levels.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/ssc-question-generation.git](https://github.com/yourusername/ssc-question-generation.git)
cd ssc-question-generation
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To generate questions, run the following command:

```bash
python generate_questions.py --input dataset.csv --output questions.txt
```

Replace `dataset.csv` with your dataset file and `questions.txt` with the desired output file name.

## Results

The generated questions are evaluated based on relevance, difficulty level, and diversity. Here are some sample questions generated by the model:

1. **Sample Question 1**: ...
2. **Sample Question 2**: ...
3. **Sample Question 3**: ...
